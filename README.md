# DragonflightUI 3.3.5a (WiP)
Original addon here - https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dragonflight-ui-classic

This is a modified version of the above addon to support the 3.3.5a clients

## Features

_Minimalistic - Modern - Modular_\
No carbon copy of the new retail Dragonflight UI, but a faithful adaption with extra, classic related features.\
Beta, but battle-tested inside Naxx and Ulduar, and in active development (please report any bug you might find, and feel free to request new features!).\
Based on the default UI, so most other addons should work without problems.\
Completely modular: (de-)/activate any feature you want or don't want! \
Customizable through ingame interface options (type '**/dragonflight**' or '**/df**' ) with profile support, \
or use the **Editmode** (type '**/editmode**').\
Hidden content (e.g. rare/elite marke on special pets, hunter approved!).\
Fast hotfixes for bugs, and frequent updates with new features.
